# Daily tips

One tip every day.

# Kaizen

Kaizen (æ”¹å–„) is a Japanese word made up of two characters:

* æ”¹ (kai) â€” "change" or "correct"
* å–„ (zen) â€” "good" or "better"

So literally, kaizen means "change for the better."

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-04-14 | `mv oldname.txt newname.txt && cat $_` | $_ can be used to get the last argument of the previous command. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-04-15 | Just type the name of the directory to autocd into it. | In Bash and Zsh autocd is on by default; use `shopt autocd` and `setopt \| grep autocd` to check. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-04-16 | Use `purrr::walk()` for side effects. | When you do not care about the return value, use `purrr::walk()` instead of `purrr::map()`. | r, functional programming |
