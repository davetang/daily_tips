# Tips

| Date | Tip | Explanation | Tags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-04-14 | `mv oldname.txt newname.txt && cat $_` | $_ can be used to get the last argument of the previous command. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-04-15 | Just type the name of the directory to autocd into it | In Bash and Zsh autocd is on by default; use `shopt autocd` and `setopt \| grep autocd` to check. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-04-16 | Use `purrr::walk()` for side effects. | When you do not care about the return value, use `purrr::walk()` instead of `purrr::map()`. | r, functional programming |
| 2025-04-17 | Use `fc` to Fix Command. | Opens your last command with `$EDITOR` and after you edit and save, the command runs immediately. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-04-18 | `diff -y file1.txt file2.txt` | `diff -y` provides a side-by-side comparison to easily spot differences. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-04-19 | `script mysession.log` | `script` save entire shell session (incl. input/output) for logging; use `exit` to stop session. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-04-20 | Use `--containall` with Singularity for better isolation | Prevents container from reading or writing from the host; useful for testing in a minimal, clean environment. | singularity |
| 2025-04-21 | `pstree -p PID` | Show processes in a tree with PID | shell, system |
| 2025-04-22 | Good enough now beats perfect later. | A working solution now is more useful than a perfect one that never arrives. | project management |
| 2025-04-23 | Consider using `tryCatch()` over `stopifnot()`. | `tryCatch()` can handle and recover from errors, while `stopifnot()` halts execution. | r, defensive programming |
| 2025-04-24 | `apropos unzip` | If you know what a command does, but not the name use `apropos` to search the man pages! | shell, documentation |
| 2025-04-25 | Use `--cleanenv` with Singularity | Using `--cleanenv` prevents the container from inheriting most of the environment variables from the host. | singularity |
| 2025-04-26 | tar -cJf archive-name.tar.xz folder/ | xz typically compresses better than gz but is slower; use for long term backups. | shell, compression |
| 2025-04-27 | `watch vcgencmd measure_temp` | Measure the temperature every second. | raspberry pi |
| 2025-04-28 | Use the dot placeholder with {purrr}. | `purrr::map_int(1:5, ~ . + 1)` vs. `purrr::map_int(1:5, function(x) x + 1)`. | r, functional programming |
| 2025-04-29 | Use `date` and `bc` to measure elapsed time. | Use `$(date +%s.%N)` to get times then use `echo "${END} - ${START}" \| bc` to get elapsed time. | shell, benchmarking |
| 2025-04-30 | Apply the aggregation of marginal gains. | Follow the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. | self-help, habits |
| 2025-05-01 | `find ~ -type f -size +100M` | Find files in your home directory that are larger than 100M using `find`. | shell, reminder |
| 2025-05-02 | `purrr::discard(~ stringr::str_detect(., "old"))` | Use `purrr::discard` to discard elements based on their values. | r, functional programming |
| 2025-05-03 | `purrr::list_rbind(my_list, names_to = "id")` | Use `purrr::list_rbind()` to combine list elements into a single data structure. | r, functional programming |
| 2025-05-04 | `f <- purrr::compose(sqrt, abs)` | Use `purrr::compose()` to combine multiple functions into one, chaining them from right to left. | r, functional programming |
| 2025-05-05 | Use `shellcheck` to lint and find potential issues in your script. | ShellCheck is a static analysis and linting tool for sh/bash scripts. | shell, linting |
| 2025-05-06 | Use the {gt} package to make nice looking tables in R. | The gt philosophy: we can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts. | r, visualisation |
| 2025-05-07 | `seq 10 \| datamash sum 1 mean 1` | GNU datamash can perform basic numeric, textual and statistical operations on input textual data files. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-05-08 | Use `rsync` over `scp` | `rsync` only transfers differences, has better support for resuming transfers, and has more features. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-05-09 | `tmpfile=$(mktemp)` | Use `mktemp` for secure, race-free temp file creation. | shell, scripting |
| 2025-05-10 | `find . -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -name "*.sh" ! -name "*.md" -exec ls {} +` | Use `!` with `find` to exclude files. | shell, productivity |
| 2025-05-11 | `trap 'echo Caught a signal (EXIT, INT, or TERM).; exit' EXIT INT TERM` | `trap` is useful for cleaning up temporary files, restoring settings, or just handling interruptions gracefully. | shell, scripting |
